# Mask for Pebble

A Pebble watch face based on the [Mask](http://www.slvczch.com/mask-watch) watch by Filip Slovacek. Each triangle turns to reveal the current time; hour on the outer, minute on the inner. The time is updated in 5-minute increments.

Colors can be inverted by accessing the settings in the Pebble application.
